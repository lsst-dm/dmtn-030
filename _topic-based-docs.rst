Topic-based documentation
=========================

The Science Pipelines documentation, following the proposed `LDM-493 Data Management Documentation Architecture`_, will use *topic-based* content organization.
In this approach, content is organized into self-contained, well-structured pieces that support a reader's current task, and that link the reader to other topics for related information.
Topic-based content differs from books, research articles, and indeed, paper manuals, where a reader is expected to gradually accumulate knowledge and context through a preset narrative.
In topic-based documentation, readers drop into specific pages to support a specific objective, but can follow links to establish context, and in effect, build a personalized curriculum for learning and using the software.

The topic-based documentation approach is widely employed by the technical writing community.
Help sites from companies like `GitHub <https://help.github.com>`__ and `Slack <https://help.slack.com>`__ use topic-based documentation.
Open source projects like `Astropy <https://docs.astropy.org>`__ also use elements of topic-based documentation philosophy.
`Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic-based_authoring>`__ is an excellent example of organically-evolving topic-based documentation.
The (currently proposed) `LDM-493 Data Management Documentation Architecture`_ also identifies topic-based documentation as the information architecture of DM's user guides.
Every Page is Page One by Mark Baker,\ [#baker]_ hereafter referred to as *EPPO*, describes the motivation and principles of topic-based documentation. 
This section is intended to brief the Data Management team on topic-based documentation concepts, following EPPO.

.. [#baker] Baker, Mark. *Every page is page one: topic-based writing for technical communication and the web*. Laguna Hills, CA: XML Press, 2013.

In topic-based documentation, a topic *often* maps to an individual HTML page or reStructuredText source file.
Baker, in EPPO ยง6.8, identified the following design principles of topics:

| 1. Self-contained.
| 2. Specific and limited purpose.
| 3. Conform to type.
| 4. Establish context.
| 5. Assume the reader is qualified.
| 5. Stay on one level.
| 6. Link richly.

Topic types
-----------

In this planning exercise, principle #3 is immediately relevant.
Topic types are predefined structures for documentation, and every implemented topic page inherits from one of these types.
For writers, topic types are valuable since provide a strong template into which the domain expert's knowledge can be filled.
Topic types are also valuable to readers since they provide systematic patterns that can be learned and used as wayfinding.
For example, Numpydoc Python API references are built on a topic type (perhaps a few, for classes and for function and for indices).
Authors immediately know how to write a Python API references, and readers immediately know how to use a Python API reference page when they see one.

Defining topic types requires us to identify every kind of documentation we will write (alternatively, each kind of thing that must be documented).
Then the topic type can be implemented as a template given to authors.
The template itself imbues topic instances with many of the characteristics of an EPPO topic, but should be backed up with authoring instructions.
In the :ref:`homepage-design` section of this technote we identify the Science Pipeline's primary topic types, and those types are designed in later sections.

Topic scope
-----------

Another aspect critical for this planning exercise is that topics are self-contained (principle #1), and have a specific and limited purpose (#2).
This means that each documentation page can be planned with an outline:

- A title.
- A purpose and scope.
- Known related documents that the page can link to, rather than duplicate.

Thus many authors can work on separate topics in parallel, knowing that each topic conforms to a uniform type pattern, and is supported by other topics.
In software architecture parlance, *topics have well-defined interfaces*. Topic-based documentation can be much more effectively planned and managed than traditional narrative writing.
